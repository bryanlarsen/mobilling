The cut-off date for claims submitted on diskette/tape cartridge is the 18th of the month. When
the 18th falls on a weekend or a holiday, the cut-off date will be extended to the following
business day. Paper error reports will be mailed within approximately one week of receipt of the
claims submission. Remittance advices are created during month-end processing and will be
mailed on diskette/tape cartridge for receipt by the 15th of the month.

Electronic Data Transfer (EDT)
The cut-off date for claims submitted via EDT is the 18th of the month; however, claims submitted
via EDT after the 18th of the month may be processed until the month-end mainframe cut-off date,
where time and volume permits. Electronic error reports will be sent via EDT approximately 48
hours after receipt of the claims submission. Remittance advices are created during month-end
processing and are available earlier by EDT, usually within the first week of the month (refer to
Electronic Data Transfer Reference Manual).

2.2 Shipping Requirements
The health care provider is responsible for transporting diskettes or tape cartridges to
the ministry offices. Diskettes must be placed in a mailer/envelope as prescribed by the ministry.
Tape cartridges must be securely packaged and may be either mailed or delivered. Diskettes or
tape cartridges submitted to the ministry must have an affixed identification label (refer to Section
2.3 – Labels).
Diskettes processed by the ministry will be reformatted or modified before being returned to the
health care provider. Tape cartridges will be returned intact.
For health care providers who choose 3.5" high density diskettes, the ministry will supply diskettes
in the approved media format. The ministry provides 3.5" high density (1.44MB/1.40 MB) diskettes
for use in production.

Remittance advice(s) on diskettes are identified with yellow labels. Remittance advice(s) on tape
cartridge are identified with a yellow six-digit Volume Serial Number. All media types remain the
property of the ministry and must be returned promptly to the appropriate ministry office upon
completion of the monthly reconciliation.

2.3 Labels
Multi-volume remittance advice diskettes are externally labeled (e.g., 1 of 3, 2 of 3) to identify the
sequence in which the volumes were created and should be read. For a multi-volume remittance
advice tape cartridge, the sequence of the volumes is identified by an accompanying report. The
total number of records in the file appears on the external label (diskette) or on the accompanying
report (tape cartridge).

3.1        Initial Claims File

New health care providers/billing agents and providers who are transitioning from submitting
their claims by paper to an electronic method can begin submitting claims to the ministry in a
live (production) environment once they are successfully registered for electronic claims
submission.

The health care provider/billing agent must submit claims data that conforms to the
specifications in this manual and to the general requirements for information exchange with the
ministry.

Health care providers/billing agents are encouraged to work closely with their local ministry
claims processing office (refer to Section 1.2 – Office Locations and Contact Numbers)
following submission of their initial claims file. The billing agent must be aware of the
importance of viewing their error reports and notifying the ministry immediately if problems or
errors are detected.

3.2        Patient Set-Up File

The Patient Set-up File is a ministry initiative intended to assist health care providers in their
transition from paper claims submission to diskette/EDT machine readable input submission.
Upon request, the ministry will supply a Set-up File diskette to providers containing basic patient
biographic information. The file consists of patient data for whom a claim has been submitted
and approved in the past six months.

The Patient Set-up File is an optional feature and is available in MacIntosh and IBM-compatible
(MS/DOS) formats. Medical billing software vendors may choose to develop a facility to load
the Set-up File contents into the computer’s patient database.

For more information, contact your local ministry claims processing office (refer to Section 1.2 –
Office Locations and Contact Numbers).

5.12       Service Location Indicator Codes

Effective April 1, 2006 the acceptable Service Location Indicator (SLI) codes for hospital
settings are:

Code             Description

HDS              Hospital Day Surgery
HED              Hospital Emergency Department
HIP              Hospital In-Patient
HOP              Hospital Out-Patient
HRP              Hospital Referral Patient

The Service Location Indicator is a “generic” field and the ministry may introduce SLI codes for
other settings in the future to support data collection for planning and forecasting purposes.

Telemedicine Codes
The Service Location Indicator code “OTN” (Ontario Telemedicine Network) is required to
identify telemedicine accounts to be processed by the OHIP claims payment processing system.

All accounts submitted to OHIP for telemedicine services from dentists and physicians must
include the telemedicine SLI code which must be:

   Located in field positions 59-62 of the Claim Header-1 Machine Readable Input Record of
    the billing
   Left justified
   Three alpha characters: OTN

The SLI code will be reported in field positions 70-73 of the Claim Header Machine Readable
Output Record.

Diagnostic Services Fee Codes
The professional fee codes that can be billed as of April 1, 2006 by physicians for diagnostic
services rendered to hospital in-patients and that require the HIP Service Location Indicator code
are listed in the Schedule of Benefits for Physician Services in the following sections:

   Nuclear Medicine – In Vivo (Section B)
   Diagnostic Radiology (Section D)
   Magnetic Resonance Imaging (Section F)
   Diagnostic Ultrasound (Section G)
   Pulmonary Function Studies (Section H)
   Diagnostic and Therapeutic Procedures (Section J)

RA Type 4:       ACCOUNTING NUMBER Sort for Health Care Provider Groups
                 The file is sorted by Health Care Provider within the Group. If the Health Care
                 Provider had service encounters processed in more than one ministry office, the
                 service encounters are further sorted by ministry Office Code. Within the above sorts,
                 the service encounters are sorted by: Health Care Provider Accounting Number,
                 Health/Registration Number and Service Encounter Number.

RA Type 5:       ACCOUNTING NUMBER Sort for Solo Health Care Providers
                 If the Health Care Provider had service encounters processed in more than one ministry
                 office, the service encounters are sorted by ministry Office Code. Within the above sort,
                 the service encounters are sorted by: Health Care Provider Accounting Number,
                 Health/Registration Number and Service Encounter Number.

RA Type 6:       HEALTH/REGISTRATION NUMBER
                 The file is sorted by: Health/Registration Number and Service Encounter Number.

RA Type 7:       ACCOUNTING NUMBER Sort for Health Care Provider Groups
                 The file is sorted by Heath Care Provider within the Group. Within the above sort, the
                 service encounters are sorted by: Health Care Provider Accounting Number,
                 Health/Registration Number and Service Encounter Number. The sort hierarchy
                 within the Accounting Number is: blanks, alphas, numerics.

A health care provider submitting claims in MRI form receives a remittance advice from the
ministry in MRO form. The provider receives a file containing the data related to the remittance
advice on the same medium as the automated claims submission. The MRO format permits health
care providers to reconcile accounts easily and quickly.

The diskette or cartridge containing the remittance advice file may be sent either to the health care
provider or billing agent. The diskette or tape cartridge remains the property of the ministry. The
health care provider must return it promptly to the appropriate ministry office after reconciliation is
completed.

One remittance advice file is created for each health care provider for every claims processing cycle
regardless of the number of submissions or input media within that cycle.

6.7        Accounting Transactions for Record Type 7

Transaction Code 10 - Advance is created when:
       A health care provider receives an interim payment (cheque or direct bank deposit).
       A health care provider receives a manual or computer issued advance (cheque only).
A Transaction Code 10 - Advance is created with the amount of the interim payment/advance. This
amount is always negative and is deducted from the total remittance payable. If it exceeds the total
remittance payable it is carried forward to the next month’s remittance as a Record Type 6 or part of
it (Amount Brought Forward - Advances) with a negative value.

Transaction Code 20 - Reduction is created when:
       A debit is required for claim items purged by the system.
       The Private Medical Laboratory Utilization Discount System requires a deduction.
       Automated estimated payment(s) are recovered.
       Other deductions as requested by various ministry branches.
A Transaction Code 20 - Reduction is created with the amount requested to be deducted. This
amount is always negative and is deducted from the total remittance payable. If the reduction
exceeds the total remittance payable, it is carried forward to the next month’s remittance as a Record
Type 6 or part of it (Amount Brought Forward - Reductions) with a negative value.

Transaction Code 40 - Advance Repayment is created when:
       An interim payment is cancelled before the payment is made.
       A provider’s personal cheque is received as repayment on a previously issued advance or
        interim payment or unrecovered part thereof.
A Transaction Code 40 - Advance Repayment is created with the amount of the interim payment/
repayment. This amount is always positive and is added to the total remittance payable. Transaction
Code 40 is also used to identify RMB accounting transactions.

Transaction Code 50 - Accounting Adjustment is created when:
       A bulk retroactive adjustment payment is processed (e.g., new Schedule of Benefits).
       Claims submitted prior to cut-off do not get fully processed for payment (e.g., Automated
        Estimated Payments).
       A provider’s personal cheque is received as a payment to offset a negative remittance advice.
A Transaction Code 50 accounting adjustment is created with the retroactive/repayment amount.
This amount is always positive and is added to the total remittance payable.

Transaction Code 70 - Attachments is created when:
       There is a legal obligation to deduct and redirect monies to a third party.

Inquiries
Inquiries regarding overpayments or underpayments should be made within one month of the
remittance advice on which the payment appears and must be made and resolved within six months
from the service date for any adjustments to payments to occur. Inquiries should be submitted to
your ministry claims processing office (refer to Section 1.2 – Office Locations and Contact
Numbers) on a Remittance Advice Inquiry (form 918-84).

Resubmission of Outstanding Claims
Claims outstanding for two payment cycles after submission should be resubmitted if payment has
not been reported on the remittance advice; however, claims should be submitted as soon as possible
after the service is rendered because this does not apply to claims where resubmission after two
payment cycles would exceed the time limits for submitting accounts as per regulatory requirements
(no later than six months after the service is rendered).

7.         Rejection Conditions

7.1        Correction of Errors
An entire batch or file may be rejected; consequently, it is recommended that batches be
maintained at a manageable size (i.e., batches should not exceed 500 claims). The originator will
be advised by telephone or by receiving a Claim Batch Edit Report through the mail or via EDT
that the rejected files or batches must be re-submitted.

Rejected individual claims/items to be corrected by the health care provider will appear on an
Error Report with the appropriate error code(s). Once corrected, the claims may be resubmitted
on a subsequent MRI file. In some cases, a ministry office will contact an originator to request
clarification of some aspect of a claim in order to facilitate assessment.

7.2        Rejection Categories
Claims data in machine readable form may be subject to rejection by the ministry at
three levels:
         Rejection of entire file submission
         Rejection of batch within a file
         Rejection of a claim within a batch
Warning messages will be issued when the fields designated as fillers are not spaces.

Rejection of Entire Submission
The entire unprocessed file will be returned to the originator if any of the following
conditions exist:
   1.1 Not an acceptable media type
   1.2 Not readable
   1.3 First record in the file is not a Batch Header Record
   1.4 Record count on the identification label must correspond to actual records within the
         file (3490 tape cartridge only)
   1.5 Not standard label (3490 tape cartridge only)
   1.6 Data records not 79 bytes
   1.7 Record too long (EDT only)
Record too short (EDT only)

Electronic Data Transfer (EDT)
Changes are required to billing software in order to receive and process the following EDT
claims output files and because the user may be accessing the remittance advice from
a different drive. The following are the technical specifications for each EDT claim output.

EDT File Reject Message

The Claim File Reject Message is sent to the EDT user ID who submitted the file, only if the
entire claims file is rejected. This report identifies the file rejected and the reasons for rejection.

File reject messages are sent with a file subject of “Mail File Reject”. These messages have a
filename in the following format:

 X        Month                            File Number                         Sequence Number

Example:         XA000001.123
Field 1          X is a constant used to identify the EDT File Reject Message
Field 2          Alpha representation for current processing cycle
                 (e.g., A for January, B for February)
Field 3          Sequential six-digit file number that indicates the position of
                 the file sending container (e.g., 000001)
Field 4          Three digit sequence number that indicates the container the file
                 was delivered in (e.g., 123)

The File Reject Message consists of two record types of 118 characters each: M01 Message
Record 1 and M02 Message Record 2.

submission.

Claims Error Report – EDT

The Claims Error Report is sent to the EDT user ID specified by the provider at the time of
application. This report lists rejected claims, with the appropriate error codes, for correction.
These claims are deleted from the ministry’s system and must be corrected and resubmitted in
order to be considered for payment.

Claim Error Reports will be sent via EDT with a file subject of Claims Error Report. These
messages will have a filename in the following format.

E/F       Month Code        Provider, Group or Operator Number               Sequence Number

Example:         EA123456.123 or EA1234.123 or FA123456.123


Field 1          E identifies Regular EDT Claims Error Report
                 F identifies EDT Individual Claims Error Report Extract
Field 2          Alpha representation for current processing cycle
                 (e.g., A for January, B for February)
Field 3          Health care provider’s solo provider numbers or registered group
                 (e.g., 123456 or 1234)
Field 4          Three digit sequence number that indicates the container the file
                 was delivered in (e.g., 123)

The EDT Claims Error Report consists of 6 record types of 79 characters:

HX1              Group/Provider Header Record
HXH              Claims Header 1 Record
HXR              Claims Header 2 Record (RMB claims only)
HXT              Claim Item Record
HX8              Explan Code Message Record (optional)
HX9              Group/Provider Trailer Record

NOTE:

     Typically there is one HX1 record per individual solo provider or one HX1 for each member
      of a group. The HX1 record will precede one or more rejected claim records for that
      individual. However, if within a group of rejected claims for a particular provider the
      SPECIALTY CODE changes, then another HX1 record is created to show the different
      specialty code.

     HXH records will be created for each claim. HXH and HXR records will be created for
      RMB claims.

     HXT records will be created for each item within the claim. The error report explanatory
      code will be added to the HXT record and HX8 records will carry the explanatory code
      description. From one to four HX8 message records will be present if there is an
      explanatory code on the item level record.

     There will only be one HX9 (trailer) record created for each unique group/provider number
      that appears in the file. If a provider has rejected claims under two specialties, even though
      there will be two HX1 records (as noted above), only one HX9 record will be produced.

9.0 Health Card Validation (HCV)

9.1.1 Overview
The Health Card Validation (HCV) System enables hospitals, physicians or other health care
providers to validate a health card when presented at the point of service. The validation
transaction checks the status and validity of the 10-digit health number of the health card
presented.

 Benefits
 Validation responses provide decision-making capability at the time of service and allow a
 health care provider to:
       reduce claim rejects
       reduce version code rejects
       reduce administrative costs
       reduce health care fraud
       verify patient data

For more information refer to the Health Card Validation Reference Manual.

Resource Access Control Facility – Password Information

The Resource Access Control Facility (RACF) is a software security program that resides on the
MOHLTC mainframe computer and limits a user’s access to specific areas of the ministry
systems and transactions.

RACF limits access to the system as well as to various levels of information on the system based
on a user’s need.

Passwords must be changed every 35 days and there is a restriction that a password cannot be
repeated within 14 occurrences.

Client systems should not perform edits on input passwords that are sensitive to the published
rules (e.g., minimum length), and must provide a facility for manually entering any arbitrary
password value. Failure to do so will likely render a client system unusable at some point in
time.

Password Guidelines
    •   Organization and/or each user registered and authorized for HCV are assigned a RACF
        ID and an initial password by the ministry.
    •   Initial passwords may be up to 8 characters long.
    •   An initial password is issued in an expired state and clients are required to change initial
        passwords prior to processing any HCV transactions.
    •   Subsequent passwords must be 6 to 8 characters long.
    •   Password changes resulting from ministry reset or revocation will be up to 8 characters
        long.
    •   Passwords must be changed every 35 days.
    •   The system maintains a history of the last 12 passwords and these passwords will not be
        permitted for re-use during the next 12 password changes.
    •   Passwords cannot contain your RACF ID.
    •   If your RACF ID is HEZZXX then these letters cannot be present in your password (e.g.,
        HEZZXX, HEZZXX01, 01HEZZXX).
    •   These common 3 character abbreviations cannot appear anywhere in the password (e.g.,
        GOV, ONT, JAN, FEB).
    •   The first 4 characters of the new password cannot match the first 4 characters of the
        current password.
    •   The 4th – 8th characters of the new password cannot match the 4th – 8th characters of the
        old password (e.g., OLDPASSWORD: SPSTST           NEWPASSWORD: CONTST).
    •   Passwords will be checked against a confidential list of passwords commonly used by
        computer hackers. Passwords found on the list will not be permitted.

9.2.1 Information Management System Connect (continued)

Unsuccessful attempts to log on with a RACF ID will result in a “lock-out” from the system. A
call to the Service Support Contact Centre at 1 800-262-6524 is required for a “reset”.

Note: A password reset occurs when the ministry reverts a password back to the system default
      password (e.g., a user forgets the current password or a RACF ID has been revoked and
      then re-issued.)

9.2.2 TCP/IP Data Specifications for use with IMS
      Connect
The following instructions are for use in developing the client access portion of the application
used to access the HCV service using TCP/IP over the integrated network.

TCP/IP Client Access Instructions for IMS Connect
Note: To be used in conjunction with the TCP/IP Data Specifications on the following pages.
           Every transaction message begins with an IRM header segment and ends with an EOM
           segment.
           The validation message includes the Input Transaction, whereas the other two (User
           ID/Password Authentication and Password Change) do not.


    Step                Description
     1     Socket       Obtain a socket descriptor.
     2     Connect      Request connection to host address.
                        Specific host name/URL to be provided during conformance testing process.
     3     Write        Fill a character buffer with (in sequence):
                            1. the appropriate IRM header 1;
                            2. the input transaction record (if required) 2;
                            3. the EOM segment.
                        Send the contents of the buffer as a single write.
     4     Read         Receive response:
                           • If a Request Status Message (RSM) is returned it means the
                               submission was rejected, or you have used Data Specification 1 or 2,
                               which only return RSM responses (refer to Health Card Validation
                               Reference Manual, Page 25, Appendix A – Response Codes).
                           • If an HCV Output Transaction is returned, process as you desire.
                           • If a CSM message is received, all available output has been received.
                           • If an EOM message is received, output may have been discarded - go
                               to step 6.
     5     Repeat       Repeat IDENTIFIED VOLUME USERS ONLY: repeat process starting at
                        step 3.
     6     Close        Terminate connection and release socket resources.

9.2.3            TCP/IP Socket Troubleshooting
Refer to the steps below before contacting Service Support Contact Centre for assistance.
The first troubleshooting step should always be to ensure that the transaction data has been
assembled correctly by referring to the IRM Header and Input Data Specification – ensure all
fields are of correct width and are correctly ordered. Some troubleshooting steps are outlined
below for steps 1, 2, and 3 of the TCP/IP Client Access for IMS Connect Data Specification.

    •   Where “z” is A or E as follows:
        •   To receive a response file containing one record for each record submitted, files
            submitted should be named OBECAxxx.ttt (A for All)
        •   To receive a response containing only those health number/version codes that
            generate a response code other than “50” (Card Passed Validation), files submitted
            should be named OBECExxx.ttt (E for Exceptions)

Advice (hard copy, tape cartridge, diskette or EDT).

Address
A computer system location identified by a name, number, or code label. The address can be
specified by the user or by a program.

ASCII File
A file that contains data made up of ASCII characters. Each byte in the file contains one
character that conforms to the standard ASCII code. Program source code, DOS batch files,
macros and scripts are written as straight text and stored as ASCII files.

Baud Rate

connected via modem.

Billing Agent
An agent authorized by a health care provider, or a group of health care providers, to prepare
their claims data on machine-readable media for processing by the ministry and/or to reconcile
payment data on machine-readable media provided by the ministry.

Bits Per Second (BPS)
A measurement of data transmission speed.

Carriage Return/Line Feed (3.5" High Density Diskettes)
End of record control characters must be present. The hexadecimal characters 0D convert to
Carriage Return in ASCII. The hexadecimal characters 0A convert to Line Feed in ASCII.
CCITT V.32BIS
A high-speed modulation protocol for computer modems that governs data transmission at
speeds of 14,400 bits per second. A modem that conforms to this standard is downwardly
compatible with V.32 modems, meaning that it can slow down to 9,600 bps to accommodate a
slower modem on the other end of the line.

CCITT V.42BIS
A data-compression protocol for computer modems that speeds transmissions by compressing
data on the sending end and decompressing the data on the reception end. If the data is not
already compressed, gains in effective transmission speeds of up to 400 percent can be realized.
