<p><b>What is MC EDT?<&#47;b></p>
<p>Medical Claim Electronic Data Transfer, also known as MC EDT is an electronic service provided by The Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care (MOHLTC) which provides doctors with a secure method of transferring electronic claim files to and from the MOH. To access MC EDT all that is required is an internet connection as it is web based, allowing doctors to submit and retrieve their claim files seven days a week, 24 hours a day. Note however that there is weekly maintenance on Sunday mornings between 1:00-5:00 am and Wednesday mornings between 5:00-8:00 am at which time MC EDT is unavailable.</p>
<p><b>How to use MC EDT?<&#47;b></p>
<p>MC EDT can be accessed through a web page which provides a simple interface where doctors can upload and download claim files depending on whether they are submitting or retrieving their claim file. <b>Note that, doctors still need a billing software to create their claim files for them as they must meet a specific format to be properly processed by the MOH. <&#47;b>You have to pay for most billing software, however we are almost finished version 3 of Mo-Billing which will allow you to create your claim files for free!</p>
