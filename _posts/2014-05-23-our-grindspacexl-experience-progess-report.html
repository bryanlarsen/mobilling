<p>As a start-up company, co-founded by founders with no business background, GrindSpaceXL has been an invaluable program so far. GrindSpaceXL is described as a business&nbsp;accelerator and it has been nothing less than that for Figure of Eight Inc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have been in GrindSpaceXL since Jan. 13th 2014, exactly 1 month and 2 days as of&nbsp;today.&nbsp; Our progress over this short time can be summarized as follows:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Week 1- Changed our business model entirely. After our first class in GrindSpaceXL, we were asking ourselves questions and exploring new avenues we may have never come across without GrindSpaceXL.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Week 2- Worked with the market research team at Invest Ottawa and conducted our own market research by reaching out to experts in the field&nbsp;to validate our business model.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Week 3- Called potential clients to set up meetings. 4 potential clients called- 4 meetings secured. All thanks to the&nbsp;<em>Buyers Buying Process&nbsp;<&#47;em>taught by Susan Englehutt at Invest Ottawa. Reached out to 3 media outlets- 3 media interviews secured.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Week 4- Meet with 4 potential clients- 4 new clients secured. Again, thanks to the Susan Englehutt's expertise. Media interviews in progress- more info to come once media is released!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A lot can happen in small time frame when you are guided by experts in the field.</p>
