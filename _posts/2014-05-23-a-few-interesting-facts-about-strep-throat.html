<p>Date written: 23&#47;01&#47;2014</p>
<p>I have compiled this in November after doing a short literature review. It is indeed quite revealing and asks a question: Why the heck do we even care about treating it?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><i>Given antibiotics<&#47;i><&#47;span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">-1 in 8 will see improvement in symptoms (for culture proven strep)<&#47;span><&#47;i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">-Mean reduction of symptoms < 1 day<&#47;span><&#47;i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">-No change in 1 week symptom rate compared to placebo<&#47;span><&#47;i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">-No effect on school&#47;work attendance.<&#47;span><&#47;i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">-1 in 10 will see side effects from antibiotics<&#47;span><&#47;i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">-Number need to treat to prevent one rheumatic fever staggering 15,000<&#47;span><&#47;i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">-No effect on glomerulonephritis rate<&#47;span><&#47;i></p>
<p><i><&#47;i><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><br />
<i>As per quite a nice review in&nbsp;<&#47;i><&#47;span><a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.cfp.ca&#47;content&#47;57&#47;7&#47;791.full" target="_blank" data-blogger-escaped-target="_blank"><span style="color: #0000ff; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><i>http:&#47;&#47;www.cfp.ca&#47;content&#47;57&#47;7&#47;791.full<&#47;i><&#47;span><&#47;a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What this basically means is that&nbsp;1 in 8 patients receiving antibiotics for a proven strep throat will see some difference, which would in turn be about half a day less of sickness. And 1 in 10 would have a side effect. My question then becomes whether I should even try to talk about 1&#47;15,000 reduction of rheumatic fever, or whether that just confuses people more. Or is 1&#47;15,000 close enough to nil-value that I should basically say antibiotics do not change the rate of any rheumatic complications whether rheumatic fever or glomerulonephritis?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other interesting findings against giving antibiotics.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><i>-Antibiotics prescription seems to increase recurrence of strep. (as per Up To Date)<&#47;i><&#47;span></p>
<p><&#47;div></p>
<div>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><i>-Amoxicillin should be avoided with empirical therapy as some viral tonsillitis such as mono will cause rash. GAS is 100% sensitive to Pen V. (at least in around Ottawa.)<&#47;i><&#47;span></p>
<p><&#47;div></p>
