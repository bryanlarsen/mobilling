<p>I tried this new trick instead of the traditional "ring block" on the finger. I went with 27G needle and infiltrated about 2mL of 2% lidocaine subcutaneously. 2mL is still is somewhat substantial volume for a small space, so I spread it around slightly by angling the needle. The result was a fantastic digital block. I need to try it out more but it looks like a winner to me.</p>
<p>Here is a good link discussing the technique.</p>
