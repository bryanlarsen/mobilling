<blockquote>
  After experiencing complicated, insecure and time consuming billing process in my hospitalist work, I thought "there has to be a better way!" Thus we created billOHIP.ca to streamline billing process; from point-of-care data entry to easy submission. You can use it as a stand-alone billing platform, or a communication tool with your billing agent.
