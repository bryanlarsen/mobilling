<p style="color: #000000;">E083 is a code that I receive a lot of questions about and seems to be one of the many codes surrounded by confusion, so I've decided to do a specific breakdown for everyone:<&#47;p></p>
<p style="color: #000000;">E083 - "subsequent visit by the MRP to subsequent visits and specific associated codes".<&#47;p></p>
<p style="color: #000000;">E083 is a 30% increase to the associated code. A few of the codes that can be associated with E083 are C002, C003, C007, C009, C132, C137, C139 - for an exhaustive listing of associated codes OMBIS members should search E083 under billing modules.<&#47;p></p>
<p style="color: #000000;"><span style="color: #222222; text-decoration: underline;">E083 is not eligible for payment with C121 additional visits for intercurrent illness<&#47;span><span style="color: #222222; font-family: tahoma, sans-serif;">.&nbsp;<&#47;span><&#47;p></p>
<p style="color: #000000;">E083 is only eligible for payment once per patient, per day, and E083 is only eligible for payment if:<&#47;p></p>
<p style="color: #000000;">a. The physician establishes that he&#47;she does not receive any direct or indirect remuneration from a hospital or hospital foundation for rendering in-patient clinical services; or<&#47;p></p>
<p style="color: #000000;">b. Where the physician receives any direct or indirect remuneration from a hospital or hospital foundation for rendering in-patient clinical services, if the physician establishes that such remuneration has been reduced by an amount equal to the amount that would be eligible for payment to the physician had he or she not received any such direct or indirect remuneration.<&#47;p></p>
<p style="color: #000000;">E083 is not eligible for payment for palliative care visits to patients in designated palliative care beds in Long-Term Care Institutions.<&#47;p></p>
<p style="color: #000000;">E083 is only eligible for payment with subsequent visits and palliative care visits rendered by the Most Responsible Physician. E083 is not applicable to any other service or premium.<&#47;p></p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Examples of subsequent visits eligible for payment in association with E083 are C002, C007, C009, C132, C137, C139, C032, C037 or C039.<&#47;p></p>
