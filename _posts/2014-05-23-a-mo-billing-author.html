<p>Hi everyone, my name is Suzan. I'd like to introduce myself as one of the mo-billing blog authors. I will be blogging about medical billing, progress of our mo-billing software and other various subjects.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A little about myself. I grew up in Belleville, Ontario a small town located approximately 3 hours south-west of Ottawa. When I graduated high school I chose to take engineering at Carleton University because of their newly added Biomedical and Mechanical Engineering program. A year ago I finished my undergraduate degree and currently, I am in the last year of my Masters of Applied Science in Biomedical Engineering, also at Carleton.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This past summer&nbsp;the progression of my master's was at a stand-still as I&nbsp;waited weeks to receive animal and human cadaveric specimens&nbsp;for my experiment. Being the type-A person I am, I love having many things on the go at once. With many projects ending at the beginning of&nbsp;summer and my master's at a stand still, I was set to find a new project.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Luckily enough I was able to meet Pil Joo (the other author you met above), a medical doctor and an engineer, who had the idea&nbsp;for mo-billing. With his idea and my technical knowledge we were able to bring mo-billing to fruition.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope you enjoy the mo-billing blog site. We want to encourage discussions relating to medical billing to further both ours, and our readers knowledge on the subject.</p>
