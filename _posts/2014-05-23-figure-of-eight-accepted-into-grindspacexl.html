<p><strong>Ottawa, ON &ndash; January 14, 2014<&#47;strong>&nbsp;&ndash; Eight, high-potential startups have been selected to join Invest Ottawa&rsquo;s GrindSpaceXL (<a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.grindspacexl.com&#47;" data-blogger-escaped-target="_blank"><span style="color: #0f7a8e;">www.grindspacexl.com<&#47;span><&#47;a>) accelerator program.</p>

<p>The program offers early-stage ventures the opportunity to work in a group environment while meeting deliverables laid out in a personalized development plan based on a needs assessment. Content focuses on four fundamental areas: market validation and go-to-market strategy; marketing communications and sales effectiveness; essential skills for success and sustainability; and financing and exit. All designed to get startups customer-focused and investor-ready.</p>
