<p>The CMA has some great resources to help residents transition from residency to practice, one of which describes the final steps in finishing residency and beginning practice. This blog aims to summarize the chapter.</p>
<p>Hospital Privileges</p>
<p>The accreditation committee of hospitals meet on a periodic basis- to avoid delays in obtaining hospital privileges, plan to have your application submitted before the meeting. The application requires several documentation such as medical license, malpractice insurance certificates and sometimes certificate of adult criminal conviction. Cost of the application can be $100-150.</p>
<p>Certification Exam</p>
<p>Residents are required to sit their respective certification examination in the final year of their training. Application to write the exam must be done one year in advance. After passing the exam, residents are then certified to practice in their respective specialty and are invited to become a fellow of the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons&#47;College of Family Physicians meber.</p>
<p>Maintenance of Certification (MOC)</p>
<p>To demonstrate commitment to continuing professional development and to provide evidence to competency physicians are required to complete a minimum of 40 credits by participating in continuing professional development activities and reporting their outcome. As a resident up to 75 credits obtaining for activities undertaken as a resident can be transferred. For family medicine physicians are required to participate in Maintenance of Proficiency where they must complete 250 Continued medical education (CME) credits over a 5 year cycle.</p>
<p>Province Licensure</p>
<p>Application to either Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons&#47;College of Family Physicians of Canada in the respective province must be made before practicing. Application are reviewed as they are received and peak times are from March-July. Provincial medical association membership is also generally required to practice in the respective jurisdiction.</p>
<p>Malpractice Insurance</p>
<p>Upon graduation residents are required to arrange their own malpractice coverage such that the insurance is in force the date medical practice begins. These dues are often paid by the employer. In some cases MOH may pay for part of the dues or funding arrangements can be made to minimize disruption of cash flow.</p>
<p>Billing</p>
<p>A billing number is required in order to earn money for the services provided on a fee-for-service basis. Upon successful registration with the respective provincial College of Physicians and Surgeons, physicians are eligible for a billing number. Applying for a billing number from the MOH should be done in a timely manner to delay payment.</p>
