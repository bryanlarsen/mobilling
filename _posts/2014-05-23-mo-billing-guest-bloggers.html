<p>The best type of person to provide us with insight and knowledge on the most common medical billing mistakes is the person that processes medical billing for a living, also known as a billing agent. Mo-Billing will be starting a series where guests with useful medical billing insights will be invited to blog and share their information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our guest bloggers will be introduced and listed on our blog, along with the blogs they have contributed to Mo-Billing.</p>
