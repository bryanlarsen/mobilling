<p>Mo-Billing is all about billing for doctors on mobile devices. On this blog, you will find OHIP billing tips for new (and seasoned) MDs. We will also keep you updated on our app development.</p>
<p>First I should introduce myself. I am a family&#47;emergency physician working out of Barry's Bay and Ottawa. I went to McGill for my undergrad in electrical engineering and then moved onto medicine. I finished my family medicine residency at University of Ottawa. I've been practising for four years mostly in the emergency rooms in various rural towns in Ontario. Recently I have also started working as a lead physician at Rainbow Valley C.H.C in Killaloe. I also hold a position of assistant professor at University of Ottawa and work part time as hospitalist at The Ottawa Hospital, Civic site.</p>
<p>All this experience has given me multiple exposure to the OHIP billing system. I had one billing agent who was, let's say not very professional. Then I trained my brother-in-law, who was very good but then left the country to pursue his dreams. Then I was doing it myself with some crummy software with terrible interface. (Why does medical software always have a million buttons, mostly with cryptic graphics on them?) "Type patient name... type OHIP number... darn, this one is rejected, I will deal with it tomorrow." Then that becomes a few months later: "oh I still haven't dealt with that error... and guess what it's been more than 6 months and OHIP won't take it." I've been pulling out my hair with this question: "why can't I find a good, reliable billing agent, communicating instantly via Internet?"</p>
<p>After a while, I came to the conclusion that there has to be a better system. Instead of carrying around stacks of paper with patient information that can be lost or forgotten on the desk, one should be able to collect this information on a mobile device with strong encryption to protect patient information. (After all, how is a stack of paper in your pocket&#47; car&#47; living room with patient information a secure way to hold such sensitive information?) Instead of arranging physical delivery of this stack of paper or worse faxing, there should be a way to communicate with your billing agent via Internet with minimal steps involved.</p>
<p>Mo-Billing is the answer to the questions above. We have an android prototype if you are interested. The launch of full-fledged version will be available for iPhone&#47;iPad, Android and desktop this fall. Keep checking this blog for product updates and pricing details.</p>
<p>We can reassure you we know ins and outs of hospitalist billing. I was there and I've been through that. I understand from a first person prospective, what a physician needs and what kind of questions physicians have. If you have a specific and unique billing case, just let us know. Our dedicated personnel will get back to you personally within one or two business days to assist and investigate the best way to bill for your hard work, however weird a case it was. No pre-typed, annoying answers. We promise!</p>
