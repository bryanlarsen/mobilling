<p>We have been working hard on producing the third version of Mo-Billing. The application is just about ready for beta testing. This new version has been completely re-designed to include an improved interface and an efficient workflow for both doctors and billing agents, either to use independently or together. Doctors can electronically submit directly to their billing agent using Mo-Billing so they can review the information, make corrections and submit it to the Ministry of Health (MOH). DIY doctors or billing agents may also use the application independently as a standalone billing software for submission to the MOH.</p>
<p>Several exciting new features have been added to V3, including but not limited to real-time tracking of compensation, auto-saving features, stored patient profiles, error detection, but most importantly the creation of submission files for the MOH and the ability to reconcile on Mo-Billing itself!</p>
<p>Get a sneak peak into V3 here!</p>

<p>What is next? Well, as of right now Mo-Billing does require users to use MC-EDT as our application creates MOH submission files which are then transferred through MC-EDT. We are beginning to work on incorporating submission directly to the MOH through Mo-Billing, no longer requiring the use of MC-EDT.</p>
<p>Keep your eyes peeled for V3 of Mo-Billing!</p>
