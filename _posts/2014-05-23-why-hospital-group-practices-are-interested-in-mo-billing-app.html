<p>We are seeing more interesting development with Mo-Billing; we are negotiating deals with departments in&nbsp;three separate large hospitals in Ontario. One group has started trialing already.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These departments have group practices where doctors share admin resources including the billing clerks. The feedback from&nbsp;the billing&nbsp;clerks&nbsp;so far are unanimous and also consistent with the opinion of other billing agents.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>They are excited about getting rid of paper with doctor's hand written information on it. The data is available as soon as the claim is submitted with clear photos. There are no excuse or confusion&nbsp;about lost claim cards. No more faxing, no more filing physical paper.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, one thing we are&nbsp;surprised with&nbsp;is that, some of these group practices were using courier services to pick up and drop off the stack of&nbsp;claim cards.&nbsp;&nbsp;Their admin&nbsp;office is often physically located away from the actual hospital, or one admin office is shared between multiple campuses. They are excited with the prospect of eliminating this expense; and one less logistical headache! One less intermediary to lose paper!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are very excited with on-going adoption of our technology among doctors.</p>
