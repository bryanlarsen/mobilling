<p>Most of the time when we blog about Mo-Billing, it is aimed primarily at physicians, so I thought I should write about how the technology could change the billing agent workflow.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While Mo-Billing is aimed at eliminating the use of paper on the front-end for physicians by providing them with a platform to collect, store, deliver and retrieve their billing information we must not underestimate its advantages in the back-end.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For billing agents, they too, are able to eliminate the use of paper and computer ink.&nbsp;Rather than receiving their clients claims by fax or by email, which they must print, they are able to log on to our server and access their clients claims electronically. They are able to organize their clients claims through our electronic system, eliminating the need to physically&nbsp;file physician claims. This could save some serious space, as we have found billing agents can store old claims anywhere from 1-3 years after they have been submitted to the Ministry of Health. Also, we have found that eliminating paper and ink can save a significant amount&nbsp;for a medium-sized billing agency.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another advantage for the billing agent, is they are able to receive claims on a continuous basis. As soon as the physician finishes the claim and clicks 'submit' the billing agent immediately has access to it. This helps them avoid cramming close to the end of the billing cycle.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Billing agents are valuable to physicians as they have expertise in billing, sometimes getting more money for physicians than they would know to claim on their own. Also, billing agents are great at dealing with claim errors and rejections- often&nbsp;a time-consuming task for physicians.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hopefully Mo-Billing will provide billing agents with a tool they can use with their clients, which will allow them to&nbsp;stay at&nbsp;pace&nbsp;with our societies technological advancements.</p>
