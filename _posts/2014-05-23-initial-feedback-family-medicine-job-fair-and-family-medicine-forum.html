<p>The past couple of weeks have been hectic but filled with valuable feedback and experiences.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the end of October we attended the Ottawa University Family Medicine job fair at Montfort Hospital. This was our first opportunity to share the idea of our Mo-Billing software and accompanying billing agent services with potential customers. Residents visited our booth and we were able to provide them with insight into&nbsp;the medical billing process they will soon&nbsp;become familiar with. Using our&nbsp;tablets (Android and Apple) we were able to demonstrate the functionality of the&nbsp;Mo-Billing app and explain how it would be used in conjunction with our billing agent services. The residents we met were supportive and provided positive feedback&nbsp;for the use of a mobile app&nbsp;for on-the-spot patient claim data collection, storage and transmission to our billing agency. Though the residents weren't entirely familiar with the current and traditional medical billing process for out-of-clinic practice, they were observant of their attending's collection of patient claim data on&nbsp;cue cards and were able to appreciate the elimination of these cue cards through the use of our Mo-Billing app.&nbsp;While connecting with residents, whom are generally comprised of&nbsp;a younger&nbsp;generation,&nbsp;it was not surprising that&nbsp;they were appreciative of&nbsp;the use of mobile devices as they are more in touch with the use of technology.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After receiving positive feedback from residents we were excited for our second presentation of our product&#47;service at the Family Medicine Forum (FMF)&nbsp;in Vancouver&nbsp;a week later, where we could&nbsp;gauge the interest of practicing physicians with&nbsp;experience with the current medical billing process.&nbsp;We were able to connect with various physicians practicing in Ontario, as well as other provinces. This was interesting as we were able to note the interest and value of our product and service&nbsp;in other provinces. Overall the feedback was positive and interest from potential customers was present. Similar to the job fair previously attended, we simply demonstrated the functionality of our Mo-Billing software and described our accompanying billing agent services to booth visitors. Practicing physicians were able to truly&nbsp;appreciate the "compelling value" of Mo-Billing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Aside:&nbsp;<&#47;strong>For those of you reading that may not know, traditionally, the medical billing process for physicians is a three-step process consisting of patient claim data collection on paper, storage of the papers over a pre-determined period of time&nbsp;and transmission of the papers to the billing agent&#47;agency for processing to the Ministry of Health. The current method of patient claim data transmission between the physician and billing gent&#47;agency is limited to in person, fax, mail or scanning and emailing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Back to the "compelling value" which, for customers using our Mo-Billing software and partnering billing agent services, is simply convenience. Customers are able to eliminate the use of paper, the hassle of storing and tracking sheets of paper containing confidential patient information as well as the inconvenience of transmitting patient claim data by fax, email, mail or in person. The collection, storage and transmission of patient claim data to our billing agency can be completed on-the-spot and in one step using our Mo-Billing software saving time for the physician.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was nice to discuss these improvements to the medical billing process&nbsp;with physicians&nbsp;experienced in using the current process&nbsp;as they had a different level of appreciation for&nbsp;the use of our product. Below is a picture of Pil and I at&nbsp;&nbsp;FMF.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By attending both the job fair and the conference we were able to make valuable connections and we are excited to see where those connections will lead. We also learned that a product and service like ours is of interest in other provinces. For now, we will be focusing on Ontario, where our web and mobile app are just recently&nbsp;available. The mobile app can be downloaded on Google Play and will be available on the iTunes store within two weeks. We will be sure to keep you updated on any future plans!</p>
