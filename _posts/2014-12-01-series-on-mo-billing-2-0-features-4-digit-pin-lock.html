<p style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: 'Segoe UI', helvetica, arial, sans-serif;">We will be featuring a new series on our blog focused on Mo-Billing Version 2.0. With a transition from paper billing to electronic billing, many concerns have been raised as our current and future users venture into untouched territory. The goal of this series is to share and explain implemented features so that our users can be at ease as they transition to an automated billing process.&nbsp;<&#47;span><&#47;p></p>
<p style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: 'Segoe UI', helvetica, arial, sans-serif;"><br />
<&#47;span><span style="font-family: 'Segoe UI', helvetica, arial, sans-serif;">Considering that doctors use their mobile phone, tablet or PC at the hospital to capture billing data using Mo-Billing, one concern at the forefront of our their minds is the security and privacy of their patient's information within the heavily populated hospital.&nbsp;<&#47;span><span style="font-family: 'Segoe UI', helvetica, arial, sans-serif;">For this reason, we have implemented an automatically timed log out mechanism into the Mo-Billing application. Previously in version 1.0 every time users wanted to log back into the program they had to type their email and password, we received complaints that this was too cumbersome as they would log in to the program several times a day.<&#47;span><&#47;p></p>

<p style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: 'Segoe UI', helvetica, arial, sans-serif;">In our newest version of the app, we have implemented a 4 digit pin lock mechanism. This allows the user to easily log back into Mo-Billing several times throughout the day by typing a unique 4 digit pin. However, after 24 hours of inactivity the user is completely booted out of the system and will be required to enter in their email and password to gain access.&nbsp;<&#47;span><&#47;p></p>
<p style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: 'Segoe UI', helvetica, arial, sans-serif;"><br />
<&#47;span><span style="font-family: 'Segoe UI', helvetica, arial, sans-serif;">Implementing the 4 digit PIN allows our users to quickly access Mo-Billing throughout the day while still providing protection to their medical billing data, ensuring others cannot easily access their information if they get a glance or a hold of their mobile phone, tablet or PC.<&#47;span><&#47;p></p>
