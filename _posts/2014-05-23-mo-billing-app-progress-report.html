<p>You have now seen some screen shots of our in-house made prototype. The prototype was used for proof of concept, and yes, we did prove our concept would work!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Using the prototype software&nbsp;created by myself, Caleb Chan and Bradley Jung, a group of Carleton University Engineering students, we were able to successfully&nbsp;bill OHIP&nbsp;a significantly large test&nbsp;batch of claims. Pil was the so called "lab rat" in the experiment, as it was his batch of claims we tested the prototype on. I did all the behind the scene submission to OHIP. Since it was my first time submitting claims to OHIP, I really learned a lot on the subject of&nbsp;OHIP billing, mostly for hospitalist work. Pil taught me the basics and I learned a lot through research and continuous contact with the MOHLTC (I'm sure they found my phone calls annoying). I will be sharing this information with you in due time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now that we've proven our concept to work we are in the process of creating our marketable version. This will be created by Jevin Maltais, the founder of&nbsp;<a href="http:&#47;&#47;quickjack.ca&#47;">Quickjack Solutions,<&#47;a>&nbsp;a company with expertise in building web and mobile apps. Together with Jevin, and based on our prototype work we have scoped out and planned our marketable version. Below is a teaser, showing part of the mock-ups&nbsp;that&nbsp;resulted&nbsp;after 2-weeks of intensive discussions&#47;meetings and multiple iterations.</p>
