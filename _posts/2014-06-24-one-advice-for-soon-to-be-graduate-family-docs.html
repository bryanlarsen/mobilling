<p>Many new family docs would work in a walk-in clinic before establishing more permanent pattern of work. If you are entertaining this kind of work, make sure you know how to give different kind of injections (IM, SC, Intradermal). It's one thing to know what kind of injections to order but another to actually be able to do it. Many walk-in clinics do not have nurses and the doc has to do it all. (Which also raises an important point that you should ask these things before signing up for the first shift. Do they have a nurse to help you? If they don't, do you feel comfortable to work in that kind of environment?)</p>
