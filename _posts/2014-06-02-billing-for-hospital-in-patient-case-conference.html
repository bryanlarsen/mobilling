While much time is spent on shift change discussing the patients and their needs, physicians need to be aware of when it is appropriate to bill for K121A Hospital In-Patient Case Conference (Page A24 in the 2014 SOB).&nbsp; Many physicians are billing and getting paid for K121A Case Conference while not meeting the requirements set out by the Ministry.&nbsp; If their billing is ever reviewed by the Ministry, they will be charged with&nbsp;<i>billing for services not rendered<&#47;i>.</p>
<p>The requirements of a case conference is; it must be a scheduled appointment; there must be at least 2 other participants in addition to the most responsible physician, this can include other physicians or regulated health professionals regarding a hospital in-patient.&nbsp; The outcome of the conference must be documented.</p>
