<p>Our server and your data are located in a high security data center in North America. To maintain the highest standards of security and safety of your data we use 128 bit SSL bank grade encryption. You do not have to worry about exposure of confidential patient information as there are no papers that can be left behind. If you lose your mobile device, your information will be protected as the data is saved on the server rather than on your mobile device.</p>
