<p><b>General information about house calls<&#47;b></p>
<p>A house call is a physician visit made to the patient in their own home. This may include anyone who can't or shouldn't come to the office to see the doctor for reasons such as disability, dementia (may forget their appointments) or VRE positive. House calls may last anywhere from 15 to 60 minutes depending on the complexity of the case. Patients should be treated as if they were in the office; for this it is important to be open and adaptable to the environment and ensure you pack the appropriate equipment. Some suggestions of what you need to take with you include:</p>
<p>&bull; Hand sanitizer</p>
<p>&bull; Flashlight</p>
<p>&bull; Stethoscope</p>
<p>&bull; Anaeroid BP monitor and selection of cuffs (pediatric, standard and large)</p>
<p>&bull; Portable Otoscope and ophthalmoscope</p>
<p>&bull; Tongue depressors</p>
<p>&bull; Ear speculums and lighted ear curettes</p>
<p>&bull; Tuning forks</p>
<p>&bull; Bandage scissors</p>
<p>&bull; Tape measure</p>
<p>&bull; Gloves and lubricant</p>
<p>&bull; Alcohol swabs, bandaids</p>
<p>&bull; Urine bottles, C&amp;S swabs and specimen bags</p>
<p>&bull; Lab requisitions, X-ray requisitions, Prescription pad</p>
<p>&bull; Dementia and depression screening tools (e.g. Montreal Cognitive Assessment, Geriatric</p>
<p>Depression Scale)</p>
<p>&bull; Community DNR forms</p>
<p>&bull; Medication flow sheets</p>
<p>&bull; Patient chart (paper or laptop for EMR)</p>
<p>&bull; Waterproof pads (for any procedure or exam that could dirty the patient&rsquo;s furniture or bed, and to</p>
<p>put bag on)</p>
<p>Before conducting house calls it is important to consider your safety. You should be comfortable going to the patients home and should not feel concern to be surrounded &nbsp;by any of the other occupants of the home. Ensure to list your house calls on your day sheets or leave the addresses with someone at all times. Other cautionary notes include steering clear of any pets you may be uncomfortable with by simply asking the patient to put the pet in a separate room and avoid tag along bed bugs!</p>
